Hi, Iâ€™m @SEJoshuaHall,
Iâ€™m a student at Launch School studying the fundamentals of software engineering. Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby.

ðŸ“« You may reach me at sejoshuahall@gmail.com.
âš¡ Fun fact: I've lived in 14 US states. I've also spent time in Uganda, South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Dubai, Amsterdam, and Mexico. I love working cross-culturally!
